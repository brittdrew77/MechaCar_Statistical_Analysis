## Linear Regression to Predict MPG


* The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were ground_clearance and vehicle_length.

* The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, since there is a linear relationship between one or more of the variables. This is apparent, because there are sizeable coeffcients for vehicle_length, ground_clearance, and AWD. 

* This linear model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively, since there is a very small p-value and there is also a large R-squared value.
