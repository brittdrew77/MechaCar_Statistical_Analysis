## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were ground_clearance and mpg.
* The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, since there is a linear relationship between one or more of the variables. This is apparent, because we have a very small p-value.
